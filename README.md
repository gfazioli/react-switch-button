# React Switch Button control

A Switch control built with and for [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/index.html)

## ⚠️⚠️New version here ⚠️⚠️

Hey, I've created a new fresh component here https://github.com/gfazioli/react-toggle

It's the same component but now working fine. Use `yarn add react-toggle-component`

and `import Toggle from "react-toggle-component"`

With this new version, you don't need to load the styles. They are embedded.

Let me know if everything is ok

## What's new in version 2.3.0

* Rewritten in ES6 version
* Add Laravel-Mix
* The props `defaultChecked` is deprecated in favor of `checked`

## What's new in version 2.2.0

* Add new mode props

## What's new in version 2.1.0

* Add square theme

## Demo & Example

Example: [http://gfazioli.github.io/react-switch-button](http://gfazioli.github.io/react-switch-button)
Live demo: [Online Demo](http://gfazioli.github.io/react-switch-button#demo)

## Installation

You can use React Switch Button by using NPM and include it in your own React build process (using [Browserify](http://browserify.org), etc).

```javascript
npm install react-switch-button --save
```

At this point you can import `react-switch-button` and its styles in your application as follows:

```js
import SwitchButton from 'react-switch-button';

// Be sure to include styles at some point, probably during your bootstrapping
import 'react-switch-button/dist/react-switch-button.css';
```

or

```js
const SwitchButton = require( 'react-switch-button' );
```

and then include the *css* in your HTML page.

Of course, you can also use the standalone build by including `react-switch-button.js` and `react-switch-button.css` in your page. (If you do this though you'll also need to include the dependencies.) For example:
```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/15.3.1/react.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/15.3.1/react-dom.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/classnames/index.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-switch-button/dist/react-switch-button.js"></script>

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/react-switch-button/dist/react-switch-button.css">
```

# Usage

```js
import React from "react"
import ReactDom from "react-dom"
import SwitchButton from "react-switch-button"

class Application extends React.Component {

    constructor( props )
    {
      super( props );
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <SwitchButton label="Click me" />
        );
    }

}

```
